# Formula One Report from the Microsoft Power BI 2023: The Complete Guide course

The goal was to create an interactive report with the Formula One data set provided by the instructor using some amazing visualizations.

To run the report data was imported from several different sources including csv, excel, JSON and this data was transformed to be ready for reporting. Several different visualizations were used and a report was generated with action icons and buttons to navigate between report pages.

The final result was a report that provides visual and detailed information about Formula One, its winners, the different races, circuits and other interesting data, presented in an interactive and didactic way.

All the data used in the visualizations was obtained from the Microsoft Power BI 2023: The Complete Guide course taught by Malvik Vaghadia on the Udemy platform.
